2. Flask backend for serving the model.
3. Web interface for user input and real-time predictions.
4. Predicts car prices based on:
  1. Name (Car name)
  2. Company (Brand like Maruti, Hyundai, etc.)
  3. Year (Year of manufacture)
  4. Price (Original showroom price)

  6. Fuel Type (Petrol/Diesel/CNG)

###  Tech Stack
1. Python
2. Flask (for backend and web server)
3. HTML/CSS (for frontend UI)
4. Pandas, Numpy, scikit-learn (for model building)
